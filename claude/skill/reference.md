# Dashboard tool reference

Run from this skill's folder: `bash run.sh <read> [argument]`, or `bash run.sh apply` with JSON on a
quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'` … `EOF`). Ids are what the tool shows after `#` (any unique start of at
least 4 characters works). Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`.

## Reads

### `today`
Today's list: suggestions waiting for ✓/✕, then to do, then done. Tasks carried over from earlier
days say *from Tue*; habits show their streak; weekly targets show this week's total.

### `week`
This week's weekly targets and times-a-week habits against their numbers.

### `goals`
Live and suggested goals, with progress, their milestones (`[x]` done, `?` suggested) and the items
linked to them.

### `list`
Everything live beyond today: upcoming tasks by date, every habit and how it repeats, every weekly
target.

### `find <words>`
Items, goals, milestones and flags whose title contains the words, archived ones included (so they
can be found again).

### `day <date>`
One day: what was on it, what was ticked, and any amounts logged.

### `history`
The last three weeks, day by day, as done/total.

### `journal`
The Gemini coach's latest weekly digest and last three evening check-ins.

### `flags`
Open flags — notes George made about something to change in the app.

### `changes [n]`
Your own last n changes (10 by default), with their ids for `undo`.

## Ops

Every op is an object with `"op"`. Add `"suggest": true` to `task`, `habit`, `target`, `goal` or
`milestone` to make it a suggestion instead of live.

### `task`
`{"op": "task", "title": "…", "date": "2026-09-18", "area": "Job", "goal": "<goal id>"}` — only
`title` is required; `date` defaults to today.

### `habit`
`{"op": "habit", "title": "…", "repeat": {…}}` — `repeat` defaults to every day. Shapes:
`{"kind": "daily"}` · `{"kind": "weekdays", "days": [1, 3, 5]}` (1 = Mon … 7 = Sun) ·
`{"kind": "perWeek", "n": 3}` · `{"kind": "weekly", "day": 5}` · `{"kind": "monthly", "date": 1}`.
Also `area`, `goal`.

### `target`
A weekly target. `{"op": "target", "title": "Applications", "target": 5, "unitLabel": "applications"}`
for a count, or `{"op": "target", "title": "Hebrew", "target": "5h", "unit": "minutes"}` for time
(`"90m"`, `"1h30"`, `"1.5h"`). Also `area`, `goal`.

### `goal`
`{"op": "goal", "title": "…", "targetDate": "2026-12-01", "why": "…", "milestones": ["…", "…"]}` —
progress is by milestones ticked.

### `milestone`
`{"op": "milestone", "goal": "<goal id>", "title": "…"}`.

### `plan`
A bigger job broken down, all as suggestions:
`{"op": "plan", "goal": {"title": "…", "targetDate": "…", "why": "…"}, "milestones": ["…"],
"tasks": [{"title": "…", "date": "…"}], "habits": [{"title": "…", "repeat": {…}}],
"targets": [{"title": "…", "target": 3, "unitLabel": "…"}]}` — every part is optional, but it needs a
goal or at least one habit, target or task. Milestones need the goal.

### `done`
Tick a task or habit (`"day"` defaults to today), or a milestone: `{"op": "done", "id": "…"}`.
Weekly targets take `log` instead.

### `undone`
Untick: `{"op": "undone", "id": "…", "day": "yesterday"}`.

### `log`
An amount on a weekly target, or on a goal measured by a number:
`{"op": "log", "id": "…", "amount": "45m", "day": "today", "note": "…"}`. Time targets take `"45m"`,
`"1.5h"`, `"1h30"`; counts take a number.

### `edit`
`{"op": "edit", "id": "…", "set": {"title": "…", "date": "…"}}`. Editable — tasks: `title, date,
area, goalId, order`; habits: `title, area, goalId, repeat, order`; weekly targets: `title, area,
goalId, target, unitLabel, order`; goals: `title, targetDate, target, unitLabel, why, order`
(`target: null` measures by milestones); milestones: `title, done, goalId, order`. A weekly target's
unit can't change — archive it and add a new one.

### `archive`
`{"op": "archive", "id": "…"}` — archives an item, goal or milestone (history is kept), removes a
logged amount or tick, or marks a flag addressed. Use `dismiss` for a suggestion.

### `accept`
Take on a suggestion: `{"op": "accept", "id": "…"}`. On a suggested goal it takes on the goal and its
milestones; its habits, targets and tasks stay suggestions to accept one by one.

### `dismiss`
Turn a suggestion down: `{"op": "dismiss", "id": "…"}`. On a suggested goal it also dismisses
everything proposed with it.

### `flag`
Note something to change in the app itself: `{"op": "flag", "text": "…"}`.

### `undo`
Undo one of your own changes, by the id `changes` shows: `{"op": "undo", "change": "…"}`. Anything
George has changed since is left alone, and the tool says so.
